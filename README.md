# Faceted Browsing Benchmark

The benchmark on Faceted Browsing aims to benchmark systems on their performance to support
browsing through linked data by iterative transitions performed by an intelligent user. By developing
realistic browsing scenarios through a dataset that comprises of different structural challenges for the
system, we aim to test its performance with respect to several choke points in a real world scenario.
