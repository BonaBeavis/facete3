## podigg-lc-via-webserver

This is a wrapper of podigg-lc that simply forwards all podigg parameters passed via the docker environment to the podigg-lc tool.
The essence of this image is, that the generated data is exposed via a web server ready for download.

Note, that podigg-lc is the RDF output wrapper around podigg; lc stands for "linked connections".


## Building and Tagging
```bash
docker build -t podigg-lc-via-web-server .
```

In order to use the image with the faceted browsing benchmark, first run the command above, then do:
```
docker tag podigg-lc-via-web-server git.project-hobbit.eu:4567/cstadler/faceted-browsing-benchmark-releases/podigg-lc-via-web-server
```


## Run
You can run the image also directly.

```bash
docker run -it podigg-lc-via-web-server
```


## Deployment
(For Hobbit contributors)

Uploading the image to the hobbit gitlab container registry requires logging in and pushing:

```
docker login git.project-hobbit.eu:4567
docker push git.project-hobbit.eu:4567/cstadler/faceted-browsing-benchmark-releases/podigg-lc-via-web-server
```

## Idea for future work
Cache priorly generated datasets in a volume; this would make any repeated data generation with the same (identifying) parameters nearly instant.
