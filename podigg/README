## Current approach
Launching the docker container starts the dataset generation


## Idea for an alternative:
This is a wrapper around podigg which launches an apache server to host a generated dataset.
Datasets are cached in a volume, and every launch first removes a symbolic link named 'latest' pointing to the most recent generated dataset,
and after finishing the generation, the link is regenerated.
